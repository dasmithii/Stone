Overview

    This is a tool for publishing to and reading from the Bitcoin
    blockchain. For fees proportional to content length, it will
    render your inputs "written in stone" and addressable by
    transaction ID.

    Per rule of Bitcoin protocol, these are writes to immutable 
    history - modifiable only by majority mining power. In just 
    minutes, they propagate to thousands of nodes around the 
    world, and for all practical purposes, mirror the integrity
    of Bitcoin as a whole.

    Note that anonymity is not guaranteed. Tor may be used to 
    proxy read and write activity. But still, transactions may be
    traced backwards to identifying actions of your past. See
    https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Anonymity for more information on 
    that point.



Usage

    Start bitcoind if you plan to write data. Reads default to 
    blockchain.info's API, but utilize the running node if one
    exists. But a local node is required only for writes.

    Reading and writing:
     >  stone write --data="hello, world!"
     >  stone write --path="example.txt"
     >  stone read <txid>

    Cost estimation:
     >  stone price --data="hello, world!"
     >  stone price --path="example.txt"



Installation

    pip install https://github.com/dasmithii/Yamba

      [or]

    git clone 
    https://github.com/dasmithii/Yamba
    cd Yamba
    python setup.py install



Testing

    First, start your bitcoind test network:
     >  bitcoind -testnet -daemon

    Once it's ready... (in the root of this project):
     >  python -m unittest discover
