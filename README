Overview
 
    Yamba publishes data through Tor and onto the Bitcoin blockchain, thereby
    providing an anonymous channel through which whistle-blowers may blow 
    their whistles.



Pricing 

    This is not free, unfortunately. Publishers must pay transaction fees
    necessary to record their information on the blockchain. Total expenses
    amount proportionally to content length.

      [or]
