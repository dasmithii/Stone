Overview

    This is a tool for publishing to and reading from the Bitcoin
    blockchain. For fees proportional to content length, it will
    render your inputs "written in stone" and addressable by
    transaction ID.

    Per rule of Bitcoin protocol, these are writes to immutable 
    history - modifiable only by majority mining power. In just 
    minutes, they propagate to thousands of nodes around the 
    world, and for all practical purposes, mirror the integrity
    of Bitcoin as a whole.

    Unrelatedly, Tor may be used to anonymize read and write 
    activity. Appending the --tor flag to Stone commands will
    proxy your requests, decoupling you from your published 
    content. But still, you may prove status as publisher via 
    digital signing.

    Note that anonymity is not guaranteed, as transactions may be
    traced backwards to identify voiding actions of your past. See
    https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Anonymity for more information on 
    this point.



Usage

    Reading and writing:
     >  stone write --data="hello, world!"
     >  stone write --path="example.txt"
     >  stone read <txid>

    Cost estimation:
     >  stone price --data="hello, world!"
     >  stone price --path="example.txt"
