Overview

    This is a tool for publishing to and reading from the Bitcoin
    blockchain. For a fee proportional to content length, it will
    render your inputs "written in stone" and addressable by
    transaction ID.

    Per rule of Bitcoin protocol, published data becomes part of an
    immutable history. Transactions propogate to thousands of nodes
    worldwide. And to modify these, one must first attain majority
    mining power in the network. So, for all practical purposes, the
    integrity of write calls mirror that of Bitcoin as a whole.



Usage

    Reading and writing:
     >  stone write --data="hello, world!"
     >  stone write --path="example.txt"
     >  stone read <txid>

    Cost estimation:
     >  stone price --data="hello, world!"
     >  stone price --path="example.txt"
