Overview

    Yamba publishes data through Tor and onto the Bitcoin blockchain, thereby
    providing an anonymous channel through which whistle-blowers may blow 
    their whistles unforgettably.

    In addition, it is capable of downloading published works from the
    blockchain. These are identified by sender address.
     


Pricing 

    This is not free, unfortunately. Publishers must pay transaction fees
    necessary to record their information on the blockchain. Expenses amount
    proportionally to content length.
